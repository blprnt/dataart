FROM ALL WALKS

The following are instructions for the construction of a sculpture that visualizes the last know addresses of around 4000 civil war veterans interred at Green-Wood cemetery. 

Each interred veteran is represented by a narrow strip of 300gsm paper, 0.5 cm in width. The color of the acrylic corresponds to the branch of military served, while the length of the strip corresponds to the age of the veteran. On the top face of each personalized strip of paper is the name and birth place of the person it represents.

The sculpture is to be assembled on a sturdy quick-crete base. 
From the center of the base, install a tall pin of an excess of 2 meters.
Each strip of paper is added to the pin according to the date which the person was interred, starting with the first to be interred at the base. 
The strip of paper points towards the last known address of the interred, in relation to Green-Wood cemetery.

Challenges
- Manually weeding out incomplete / bad address information 
- String (warm, active) vs tags (cold)
