Myself in the Background

Since moving to New York, every time I've walked in front of a person taking a photo on the street, I wonder if I am in the background of that photo. I think about what that photo might look like, the subject in the center, family members posing in front of an iconic New York scene, or a couple photographed standing the same way they do in every photo they take on their vacations, and then there’s me in the back ground. Maybe facing the camera, but probably walking away. Perhaps blurry, but maybe you can tell that it’s unmistakably me. And do those people think to themselves, "I wonder who that is? I wish they weren't in my otherwise lovely photo.” Or do they think of the events that led them to the place where the photo was taken, and do they imagine the same for me and my life?

If I could somehow compile all of these photos of *myself in the background* in the photos of others, what would this corpus of photos show? 

Would they show me as a blur as I stride past, almost indistinguishable as I near the foreground under the arch in Washington Square Park? Or would I be standing, waiting, identifiable, as I held an expression on my face that reflects some inner thought as my mind runs through my preoccupations walking from the train to NYU? Would I see myself arguing with a loved one in public? Would I be immediately embarrassed upon seeing those photos, as the people in the foreground smiled for the camera so their memories of their trip to New York embodied their enthusiasm? Would I be crying on the phone as I received the news that my uncle passed away a month after grandmother? Would I be a speck of black clothing in a field colorful clothing no a rolling hill in Central Park? A pale blurry body in the background on laying on Fort Tilden beach? Would I be shoving an empanada in my mouth unknowingly standing near a celebrity as fans snapped pictures?

Would there be countless photos of my back turned from the camera, or side profiles? Where I am one of many people in a sea of others, almost anonymous.

What would be true across all of these photos is that I wouldn’t be conscious I was in them as they were being taken. And this might make them more honest portraits of myself, since I would not know that I was being documented, not posting for the camera, not awkwardly dealing with the fact that I don’t know what to do when in front of the camera so I do something stupid, not shy, not self-consicious.

Or if we all had our own archives of *us in the background* in the photos of others, would we all collectively wonder about each others’ lives as we page through our collection knowing that the corpus presented to us resembles the corpuses that others are examining themselves?

As I imagine this archive of photos, I'm starting to realize there is a precedent for this, and in some way, that it probably already exists. How many times have my squinting expressions, my shouting matches, my outbursts of laughter, my embarrassment after stumbling on perfectly smooth pavement, my pure administration for another person as I stare into their eyes, how many times have these moments been recorded by a surveillance camera?

Has this ephemeral trace of me, but genuine documentation of myself, been gazed upon before I have had the chance to, violated by the eyes of another?

Has someone already looked at my archive of *myself in the background* before I have had the chance?
But furthermore, will I ever see it at all?
