Sorry for submitting my homework late. I didn't figure out how to hand in my homework through github yesterday and had someone help me out today.

I'm using Geographic API and Article Search API for my homework. On the right side of the chart is the population of countries, and on the left side is the "hits" in the last ten years. I only use "US" for United States, actually you can use "US", "United States", "America" etc. But since it's New York Times we actually should filter US out. Then we can see the population of a country and how much focus it gets in the last ten years, referring to the hits. When I trid to connect to the API frequently I got a lot of 403 response, and I missed out the data for some countries, so I have another static version which puts all my data in arries.

At first I only wanted to use the Geographic API and show the relationship between the population and location (latitude and longitude). But I kept thinking how can the whole thing makes more sense and I found that when you put data of different dimensions together, it becomes more interesting, like combining the average hours of annual sunshine & life expectancy & life satisfication. So this is my first try.
