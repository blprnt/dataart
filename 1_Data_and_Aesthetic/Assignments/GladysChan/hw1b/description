For this assignment, I used John Choi's dataset of how often each color of the rainbow is mentioned in NYT.
Because of my tendency to be overly code-oriented and forget the aesthetics/artistic side of things, I thought I would forego code, and focus on the ideal expression alone. I ranked the rainbow colors by frequency and mapped each year's results from 2007-2014 onto a wedge of the rainbow shape. Each of 8 wedges in the rainbow represents a year, the ranking for that year is represented at the left edge. Instead of following the shape to the T (resulting in a rainbow that looks "stepped" and not quite natural), I connected each color across the years for a noodly, wavy, more natural aesthetic.
