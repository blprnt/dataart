1987* LEAD: Shakespeare and opera remain passionate, if somewhat mistrustful, partners after 200 years. The language of the plays literally breathes with music, and their allure for composers is as irresistible as it is duplicitous. Opera, in other words,...
1987* LEAD: Benjamin Britten's operas are, on the whole, the best extant in the English language, and ought to be in regular repertory with all American companies. But - being British and being difficult - they are not quite ''ours'' in the way that...

1988* LEAD: ''Pyramus and Thisby,'' the play-within-the-play performed by Bottom and his fellow workmen, usually provides a hilarious finale to ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' That is most pointedly not the case in Mark Lamos's production of Shakespeare's...

1990* LEAD: In 1979 I saw an aerial photograph of the Mayan pyramid at Coba. The pyramid itself was invisible because trees and vines had grown over it. There was only a green hump in the green jungle.
1990* LEAD: It's a bleak day in Manhattan as I'm writing this, and I can't help wondering why I'm here and not on some gorgeous tropical island. In fact, I wonder why I've never been on a gorgeous tropical island. My favorite Broadway number is still...
1990* LEAD: I have for many years been fascinated by Romania, and in particular by Bucharest. It is a purely literary fascination. It began when I read Olivia Manning's ''Balkan Trilogy,'' from whose pages there rose a seedy glamour, a whiff of alluring...
